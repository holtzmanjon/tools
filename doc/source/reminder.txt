reminder module
***************

reminder is a tool that sends email to desired recipients based on dates,
email addresses, and a comment field in a TSV file.  This may be useful
for group based reminders. The TSV file may be downloaded, e.g., from a 
Google doc: this is how it is used for NMSU astroph reminders.
